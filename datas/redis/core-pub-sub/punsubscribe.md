PUNSUBSCRIBE [pattern [pattern ...]]

When no patterns are specified, the client is unsubscribed from all the previously subscribed patterns. In this case, a message for every unsubscribed pattern will be sent to the client.

## Return

When successful, this command doesn't return anything. Instead, for each pattern, one message with the first element being the string "punsubscribe" is pushed as a confirmation that the command succeeded.
