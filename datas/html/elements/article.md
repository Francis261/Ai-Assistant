# <article>: The Article Contents element

Source: https://devdocs.io/html/reference/elements/article

The <article> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

## Try it

```
<article class="forecast">
  <h1>Weather forecast for Seattle</h1>
  <article class="day-forecast">
    <h2>03 March 2018</h2>
    <p>Rain.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="day-forecast">
    <h2>04 March 2018</h2>
    <p>Periods of rain.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="day-forecast">
    <h2>05 March 2018</h2>
    <p>Heavy rain.</p>
  </article>
</article>
```

```
.forecast {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0.3rem;
  background-color: #eeeeee;
}

.forecast > h1,
.day-forecast {
  margin: 0.5rem;
  padding: 0.3rem;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.day-forecast {
  background: right/contain content-box border-box no-repeat
    url("/shared-assets/images/examples/rain.svg") white;
}

.day-forecast > h2,
.day-forecast > p {
  margin: 0.2rem;
  font-size: 1rem;
}
```

A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of each article one after another as the reader scrolls, each post would be contained in an <article> element, possibly with one or more <section>s within.

## Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

## Usage notes

- Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1> - <h6> element) as a child of the <article> element.
- When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.
- Author information of an <article> element can be provided through the <address> element, but it doesn't apply to nested <article> elements.
- The publication date and time of an <article> element can be described using the datetime attribute of a <time> element.

## Examples

```
<article class="film_review">
  <h2>Jurassic Park</h2>
  <section class="main_review">
    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>Dinos were great!</p>
  </section>
  <section class="user_reviews">
