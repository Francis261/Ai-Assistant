# <p>: The Paragraph element

Source: https://devdocs.io/html/reference/elements/p

The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing </p> tag. See "Tag omission" below.

## Try it

```
<p>
  Geckos are a group of usually small, usually nocturnal lizards. They are found
  on every continent except Antarctica.
</p>

<p>
  Some species live in houses where they hunt insects attracted by artificial
  light.
</p>
```

```
p {
  margin: 10px 0;
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid #999999;
}
```

## Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Note: The align attribute on <p> tags is obsolete and shouldn't be used.

## Accessibility

Breaking up content into paragraphs helps make a page more accessible. Screen-readers and other assistive technology provide shortcuts to let their users skip to the next or previous paragraph, letting them skim content like how white space lets visual users skip around.

Using empty <p> elements to add space between paragraphs is problematic for people who navigate with screen-reading technology. Screen readers may announce the paragraph's presence, but not any content contained within it — because there is none. This can confuse and frustrate the person using the screen reader.

If extra space is desired, use CSS properties like margin to create the effect:

```
p {
  margin-bottom: 2em; /* increase white space after a paragraph */
}
```

## Examples

### HTML

```
<p>
  This is the first paragraph of text. This is the first paragraph of text. This
  is the first paragraph of text. This is the first paragraph of text.
</p>
<p>
  This is the second paragraph. This is the second paragraph. This is the second
  paragraph. This is the second paragraph.
</p>
```

### Result

## Styling paragraphs

By default, browsers separate paragraphs with a single blank line. Alternate separation methods, such as first-line indentation, can be achieved with CSS:

### HTML

```
<p>
  Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest for readers to scan, but
  they can also be separated by indenting their first lines. This is often used
  to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.
</p>

<p>
  Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school papers and rough drafts,
  uses both blank lines and indentation for separation. In finished works,
  combining both is considered redundant and amateurish.
</p>

<p>
  In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a special character: ¶,
  the <i>pilcrow</i>. Nowadays, this is considered claustrophobic and hard to
  read.
</p>

<p>
  How hard to read? See for yourself:
  <button data-toggle-text="Oh no! Switch back!">
    Use pilcrow for paragraphs
  </button>
</p>
```

### CSS

```
p {
  margin: 0;
  text-indent: 3ch;
}

p.pilcrow {
  text-indent: 0;
  display: inline;
}
p.pilcrow + p.pilcrow::before {
  content: " ¶ ";
}
```

### JavaScript

```
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  document.querySelectorAll("p").forEach((paragraph) => {
    paragraph.classList.toggle("pilcrow");
  });

  [event.target.innerText, event.target.dataset.toggleText] = [
    event.target.dataset.toggleText,
    event.target.innerText,
  ];
});
```
