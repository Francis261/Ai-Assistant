# Date.prototype.getYear()

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The getYear() method of Date instances returns the year for this date according to local time. Because getYear() does not return full years ("year 2000 problem"), it is deprecated and has been replaced by the getFullYear() method.

## Syntax

```
getYear()
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

An integer representing the year for the given date according to local time, minus 1900. Returns NaN if the date is invalid.

- For years greater than or equal to 2000, the value is 100 or greater. For example, if the year is 2026, getYear() returns 126.
- For years between and including 1900 and 1999, the value returned by getYear() is between 0 and 99. For example, if the year is 1976, getYear() returns 76.
- For years less than 1900, the value returned by getYear() is less than 0. For example, if the year is 1800, getYear() returns -100.

This method essentially returns the value of getFullYear() minus 1900. You should use getFullYear() instead, so that the year is specified in full.

## Examples

### Years between 1900 and 1999

The second statement assigns the value 95 to the variable year.

```
const xmas = new Date("1995-12-25");
const year = xmas.getYear(); // returns 95
```

### Years above 1999

The second statement assigns the value 100 to the variable year.

```
const xmas = new Date("2000-12-25");
const year = xmas.getYear(); // returns 100
```

### Years below 1900

The second statement assigns the value -100 to the variable year.

```
const xmas = new Date("1800-12-25");
const year = xmas.getYear(); // returns -100
```

### Setting and getting a year between 1900 and 1999

The third statement assigns the value 95 to the variable year, representing the year 1995.

```
const xmas = new Date("2015-12-25");
xmas.setYear(95);
const year = xmas.getYear(); // returns 95
```
