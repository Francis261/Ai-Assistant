# Object() constructor

Source: https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/object/object

The Object() constructor turns the input into an object. Its behavior depends on the input's type.

## Syntax

```
new Object()
new Object(value)

Object()
Object(value)
```

Note: Object() can be called with or without new, but sometimes with different effects. See Return value.

### Parameters

Any value.

### Return value

When the Object() constructor itself is called or constructed, its return value is an object:

- If the value is null or undefined, it creates and returns an empty object.
- If the value is an object already, it returns the value.
- Otherwise, it returns an object of a type that corresponds to the given value. For example, passing a BigInt primitive returns a BigInt wrapper object.

When Object() is constructed but new.target is not the Object constructor itself, the behavior is slightly different — it initializes a new object with new.target.prototype as its prototype. Any argument value is ignored. This may happen, for example, when Object() is implicitly called via super() in the constructor of a class that extends Object. In this case, even if you pass a number to super(), the this value inside the constructor does not become a Number instance.

## Examples

### Creating a new Object

```
const o = new Object();
o.foo = 42;

console.log(o);
// { foo: 42 }
```

### Using Object given undefined and null types

The following examples store an empty Object object in o:

```
const o = new Object();
```

```
const o = new Object(undefined);
```

```
const o = new Object(null);
```

### Obtaining wrapper objects for BigInt and Symbol

The BigInt() and Symbol() constructors throw an error when called with new, to prevent the common mistake of creating a wrapper object instead of the primitive value. The only way to create a wrapper object for these types is to call Object() with them:

```
const numberObj = new Number(1);
console.log(typeof numberObj); // "object"

const bigintObj = Object(1n);
console.log(typeof bigintObj); // "object"

const symbolObj = Object(Symbol("foo"));
console.log(typeof symbolObj); // "object"
```
