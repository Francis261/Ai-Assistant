# Generator.prototype.return()

Source: https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/generator/return

The return() method of Generator instances acts as if a return statement is inserted in the generator's body at the current suspended position, which finishes the generator and allows the generator to perform any cleanup tasks when combined with a try...finally block.

## Syntax

```
generatorInstance.return()
generatorInstance.return(value)
```

### Parameters

The value to return.

### Return value

An Object with two properties:

A boolean value:

- true if the generator function's control flow has reached the end.
- false if the generator function's control flow hasn't reached the end and can produce more values. This can only happen if the return is captured in a try...finally and there are more yield expressions in the finally block.

The value that is given as an argument, or, if the yield expression is wrapped in a try...finally, the value yielded/returned from the finally block.

### Exceptions

Thrown if the generator is already running.

## Description

The return() method, when called, can be seen as if a return value; statement is inserted in the generator's body at the current suspended position, where value is the value passed to the return() method. Therefore, in a typical flow, calling return(value) will return { done: true, value: value }. However, if the yield expression is wrapped in a try...finally block, the control flow doesn't exit the function body, but proceeds to the finally block instead. In this case, the value returned may be different, and done may even be false, if there are more yield expressions within the finally block.

## Examples

### Using return()

The following example shows a generator and the return method.

```
function* gen() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const g = gen();

g.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }
g.return("foo"); // { value: "foo", done: true }
g.next(); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

If return(value) is called on a generator that is already in "completed" state, the generator will remain in "completed" state.

If no argument is provided, the value property of the returned object will be undefined. If an argument is provided, it will become the value of the value property of the returned object, unless the yield expression is wrapped in a try...finally.

```
function* gen() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const g = gen();
g.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }
g.next(); // { value: 2, done: false }
g.next(); // { value: 3, done: false }
g.next(); // { value: undefined, done: true }
g.return(); // { value: undefined, done: true }
g.return(1); // { value: 1, done: true }
```

### Using return() with try...finally

The fact that the return method has been called can only be made known to the generator itself if the yield expression is wrapped in a try...finally block.

When the return method is called on a generator that is suspended within a try block, execution in the generator proceeds to the finally block — since the finally block of try...finally statements always executes.

```
function* gen() {
  yield 1;
  try {
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
  } finally {
    yield "cleanup";
  }
}

const g1 = gen();
g1.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }

// Execution is suspended before the try...finally.
g1.return("early return"); // { value: 'early return', done: true }

const g2 = gen();
g2.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }
g2.next(); // { value: 2, done: false }

// Execution is suspended within the try...finally.
g2.return("early return"); // { value: 'cleanup', done: false }

// The completion value is preserved
g2.next(); // { value: 'early return', done: true }

// Generator is in the completed state
g2.return("not so early return"); // { value: 'not so early return', done: true }
```

The return value of the finally block can also become the value of the result returned from the return call.

```
function* gen() {
  try {
    yield 1;
  } finally {
    return "cleanup";
  }
}

const generator = gen();
generator.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }
generator.return("early return"); // { value: 'cleanup', done: true }
```
