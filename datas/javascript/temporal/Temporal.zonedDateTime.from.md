# Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from()

Source: https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/temporal/zoneddatetime/from

The Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from() static method creates a new Temporal.ZonedDateTime object from another Temporal.ZonedDateTime object, an object with date, time, and time zone properties, or an RFC 9557 string.

## Syntax

```
Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(info)
Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(info, options)
```

### Parameters

One of the following:

- A Temporal.ZonedDateTime instance, which creates a copy of the instance.
- An RFC 9557 format string containing a date, optionally a time, optionally an offset, a time zone annotation, and optionally a calendar.
- An object containing properties that are accepted by either Temporal.PlainDate.from() (calendar, era, eraYear, year, month, monthCode, day) or Temporal.PlainTime.from() (hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond). The info should explicitly specify a year (as year or as era and eraYear), a month (as month or monthCode), and a day; others are optional and will be set to their default values. The following properties should be provided too: timeZone Either a string or a Temporal.ZonedDateTime instance representing the time zone to use. If a Temporal.ZonedDateTime instance, its time zone is used. If a string, it can be a named time zone identifier, an offset time zone identifier, or a date-time string containing a time zone identifier or an offset (see time zones and offsets for more information). The time properties are interpreted in this time zone. offset Optional An offset string, in the same format as the RFC 9557 offset but with optional seconds and subsecond components (±HH:mm:ss.sssssssss), representing the offset from UTC. If omitted, it will be calculated from the time zone and the date-time. "Z" is not allowed.

Either a string or a Temporal.ZonedDateTime instance representing the time zone to use. If a Temporal.ZonedDateTime instance, its time zone is used. If a string, it can be a named time zone identifier, an offset time zone identifier, or a date-time string containing a time zone identifier or an offset (see time zones and offsets for more information). The time properties are interpreted in this time zone.

An offset string, in the same format as the RFC 9557 offset but with optional seconds and subsecond components (±HH:mm:ss.sssssssss), representing the offset from UTC. If omitted, it will be calculated from the time zone and the date-time. "Z" is not allowed.

An object containing some or all of the following properties (in the order they are retrieved and validated):

What to do if the local date-time is ambiguous in the given time zone (there are more than one instants with such local time, or the local time does not exist). Possible values are "compatible", "earlier", "later", and "reject". Defaults to "compatible". For more information about these values, see ambiguity and gaps from local time to UTC time.

What to do if the offset is explicitly provided in info but the offset is invalid for the given time zone in the given local time. Possible values are "use", "ignore", "reject", and "prefer". Defaults to "reject". For more information about these values, see offset ambiguity.

A string specifying the behavior when a date component is out of range (when using the object info). Possible values are:

The date component is clamped to the valid range.

A RangeError is thrown if the date component is out of range.

### Return value

A new Temporal.ZonedDateTime object, representing the date and time specified by info in the specified calendar and timeZone.

### Exceptions

Thrown in one of the following cases:

- info is not an object or a string.
- options is not an object or undefined.
- The provided properties are insufficient to unambiguously determine a date. You usually need to provide a year (or era and eraYear), a month (or monthCode), and a day.

Thrown in one of the following cases:

- The provided properties that specify the same component are inconsistent.
- The provided non-numerical properties are not valid; for example, if monthCode is never a valid month code in this calendar.
- The provided numerical properties are out of range, and options.overflow is set to "reject".
- The wall-clock time is ambiguous in the time zone, and options.disambiguation is set to "reject".
- The info is not in the representable range, which is ±108 days, or about ±273,972.6 years, from the Unix epoch.

## Examples

### Creating a ZonedDateTime from an object

```
// Year + month + day + hour + minute + second
const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({
  timeZone: "America/New_York",
  year: 2021,
  month: 7,
  day: 1,
  hour: 12,
  minute: 34,
  second: 56,
});
console.log(zdt.toString()); // "2021-07-01T12:34:56-04:00[America/New_York]"
```

### Creating a ZonedDateTime from a string

```
const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(
  "2021-07-01T12:34:56-04:00[America/New_York]",
);
console.log(zdt.toLocaleString()); // "7/1/2021, 12:34:56 PM EDT" (assuming en-US locale)

// Time given as UTC, and converted to local
const zdt2 = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(
  "2021-07-01T12:34:56Z[America/New_York]",
);
console.log(zdt2.toString()); // "2021-07-01T08:34:56-04:00[America/New_York]"
```

### Creating a ZonedDateTime from an ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 string

Note that Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from() rejects ISO 8601 strings, which do not include a time zone identifier. This is to ensure that the time zone is always known and can be used to derive different offsets as the local time changes.

If you want to parse an ISO 8601 string, first construct a Temporal.Instant object and then convert it to a Temporal.ZonedDateTime object. You can provide any time zone, even if it doesn't match the offset originally given in the string, and the local time will be adjusted accordingly.

```
const isoString = "2021-07-01T12:34:56+02:00";
const instant = Temporal.Instant.from(isoString);
const zdt = instant.toZonedDateTimeISO("America/New_York");
console.log(zdt.toString()); // "2021-07-01T06:34:56-04:00[America/New_York]"
```

### Local time disambiguation

See ambiguity and gaps from local time to UTC time for an introduction to this situation.

```
const localTimeNotExist = "2024-03-10T02:05:00[America/New_York]";
// For non-existent times, "compatible" is equivalent to "later"
const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(localTimeNotExist);
console.log(zdt.toString()); // "2024-03-10T03:05:00-04:00[America/New_York]"

const zdt2 = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(localTimeNotExist, {
  disambiguation: "earlier",
});
console.log(zdt2.toString()); // "2024-03-10T01:05:00-05:00[America/New_York]"

const localTimeAmbiguous = "2024-11-03T01:05:00[America/New_York]";
// For ambiguous times, "compatible" is equivalent to "earlier"
const zdt3 = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(localTimeAmbiguous);
console.log(zdt3.toString()); // "2024-11-03T01:05:00-04:00[America/New_York]"

const zdt4 = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(localTimeAmbiguous, {
  disambiguation: "later",
});
console.log(zdt4.toString()); // "2024-11-03T01:05:00-05:00[America/New_York]"
```

### Resolving offset ambiguity

See offset ambiguity for an introduction to this situation.

```
const offsetAmbiguous = "2019-12-23T12:00:00-02:00[America/Sao_Paulo]";

Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(offsetAmbiguous);
// RangeError: date-time can't be represented in the given time zone
Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(offsetAmbiguous, { offset: "use" }).toString();
// "2019-12-23T11:00:00-03:00[America/Sao_Paulo]"
Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(offsetAmbiguous, { offset: "ignore" }).toString();
// "2019-12-23T12:00:00-03:00[America/Sao_Paulo]"
```
