# Temporal.PlainTime.prototype.toLocaleString()

Source: https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/temporal/plaintime/tolocalestring

The toLocaleString() method of Temporal.PlainTime instances returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of this time. In implementations with Intl.DateTimeFormat API support, this method delegates to Intl.DateTimeFormat.

Every time toLocaleString is called, it has to perform a search in a big database of localization strings, which is potentially inefficient. When the method is called many times with the same arguments, it is better to create an Intl.DateTimeFormat object and use its format() method, because a DateTimeFormat object remembers the arguments passed to it and may decide to cache a slice of the database, so future format calls can search for localization strings within a more constrained context.

## Syntax

```
toLocaleString()
toLocaleString(locales)
toLocaleString(locales, options)
```

### Parameters

The locales and options parameters customize the behavior of the function and let applications specify the language whose formatting conventions should be used.

In implementations that support the Intl.DateTimeFormat API, these parameters correspond exactly to the Intl.DateTimeFormat() constructor's parameters. Implementations without Intl.DateTimeFormat support return the exact same string as toString(), ignoring both parameters.

A string with a BCP 47 language tag, or an array of such strings. Corresponds to the locales parameter of the Intl.DateTimeFormat() constructor.

An object adjusting the output format. Corresponds to the options parameter of the Intl.DateTimeFormat() constructor. Regarding the date-time component options and the style shortcuts (dateStyle and timeStyle), the options should follow one of these forms:

- Provide none of them: hour, minute, and second will default to "numeric".
- Provide timeStyle only: it expands to dayPeriod, hour, minute, second, and fractionalSecondDigits formats.
- Provide some date-time component options, where at least one of them is a time option (dayPeriod, hour, minute, second, fractionalSecondDigits). Only the specified time components will be included in the output.

See the Intl.DateTimeFormat() constructor for details on these parameters and how to use them.

### Return value

A string representing the given time according to language-specific conventions.

In implementations with Intl.DateTimeFormat, this is equivalent to new Intl.DateTimeFormat(locales, options).format(time), where options has been normalized as described above.

Note: Most of the time, the formatting returned by toLocaleString() is consistent. However, the output may vary between implementations, even within the same locale — output variations are by design and allowed by the specification. It may also not be what you expect. For example, the string may use non-breaking spaces or be surrounded by bidirectional control characters. You should not compare the results of toLocaleString() to hardcoded constants.

### Exceptions

Thrown if any of the options is invalid.

Thrown if any of the options is not of the expected type.

## Examples

### Using toLocaleString()

Basic use of this method without specifying a locale returns a formatted string in the default locale and with default options.

```
const time = Temporal.PlainTime.from("12:34:56");

console.log(time.toLocaleString()); // 12:34:56 PM (assuming en-US locale)
```

### Using toLocaleString() with options

You can customize which parts of the time are included in the output by providing the options parameter.

```
const time = Temporal.PlainTime.from("12:34:56");
time.toLocaleString("en-US", { timeStyle: "short" }); // 12:34 PM
time.toLocaleString("en-US", { hour: "2-digit" }); // 12 PM
```
